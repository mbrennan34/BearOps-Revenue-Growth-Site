        <h1>Roles, Talent Fit & Leadership Cadence</h1>
        <p class="hero-subtitle">
            Designing the right org structure, hiring profile, and leadership rhythm so your managers stop firefighting 
            and start consistently improving performance.
        </p>
        <div class="problem-statement">
            <strong>The Problem:</strong> As you scale, you add titles faster than clarity. AEs, SDRs, AMs and CSMs 
            have overlapping responsibilities. Managers run 1:1s and team meetings, but there’s no consistent structure, 
            and coaching is ad hoc at best.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Revenue is now a team sport. If roles aren’t clearly defined and your leadership cadence isn’t tight, 
            you end up paying for capacity you never fully unlock. Underperformers linger, top performers carry the 
            load, and you as CEO get dragged into people issues you shouldn’t be owning.
        </p>
