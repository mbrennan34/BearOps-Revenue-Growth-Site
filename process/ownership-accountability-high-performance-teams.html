            <h1>Ownership, Accountability &amp; High-Performance Teams</h1>
            <p class="hero-subtitle">
                Turn your EOS Accountability Chart, People Analyzer, L10 cadence and Issues list into a real operating system for ownership across your revenue team – not just a set of slides.
            </p>

            <div class="problem-statement">
                <strong>The Problem:</strong> By the time you’re at $3–10M ARR, you’ve bolted on leaders, pods and “special projects” faster than you’ve clarified who actually owns what. Titles look good on the org chart, but day-to-day decisions loop, issues resurface and founders get dragged back into people decisions they thought they’d delegated.
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS + WHAT WE BUILD -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>
            <p>
                At the founder-led stage, the CEO is the de facto owner of everything. That works at 5–10 people. Once you hit 25–80 people, it breaks completely. You hire smart people who end up stepping on each other’s toes – not because they’re incompetent, but because no one has clearly defined who owns what.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result? Decisions that should take days take weeks. The same issues reappear in L10. “Shadow owners” quietly carry the load without authority. High performers get frustrated; average performers hide in the grey areas. “Everyone owns revenue” becomes “no one owns revenue.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Component 3 connects three critical layers of your People Operating System:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Seats &amp; Structure:</strong> Functions → seats → people, with one owner per outcome.</li>
                <li><strong>Fit &amp; Performance:</strong> Values + GWC (Gets it, Wants it, Capacity) via the People Analyzer.</li>
                <li><strong>Cadence &amp; Culture:</strong> Issues, IDS and L10 discipline, backed by a culture &amp; accountability heatmap so you can see if it’s actually working.</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="framework-card">
                    <h4>Ownership &amp; Accountability Pre-Assessment</h4>
                    <p>
                        A structured baseline of where ownership breaks down today: looping decisions, unresolved issues, “not my job” excuses and unclear seats. This becomes your before/after lens for Component 3.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Accountability Chart Hub</h4>
                    <p>
                        A living Accountability Chart that maps functions, seats and outcomes in one place – designed as the source of truth for org design, hiring priorities and leadership discussion. Not just an org chart, but a map of who owns which results.
                    </p>

                    <h4>People Analyzer &amp; GWC Grid</h4>
                    <p>
                        A full People Analyzer tied directly to your seats. You score values (+ / ± / –) and GWC for each person by seat, and get clear signals on where you’ve got Right Person / Right Seat – and where you don’t.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A simple, visual summary of who is in the right seat, where you’re over-relying on heroes, and where you have structural gaps. This becomes your people decisions pipeline for the next 1–3 quarters.

                    <p>
                        A dedicated issues pipeline for people, structure and accountability. Every people issue is captured, prioritised, assigned an owner and driven through IDS (Identify–Discuss–Solve) with clear next actions.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="framework-card">
                    <h4>L10 &amp; Culture / Accountability Heatmap</h4>
                    <p>
                        A tailored L10 pack, plus a culture &amp; accountability heatmap that scores clarity of seats, ownership, people-decision discipline and L10/IDS rhythm today vs. 12-month target – so you can see if the operating system is actually embedding.

        <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>How This Works in Practice</h2>
            <p>Most teams complete Component 3 over an intensive 3–4 week window.</p>

            <h3>Week 1: Baseline &amp; Ownership Reality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete the Ownership &amp; Accountability Pre-Assessment.</li>
                <li>Capture where ownership breaks down: looping decisions, shadow owners, repeated issues, unclear seats.</li>
                <li>Run leadership interviews to understand real decision patterns vs. the theoretical org chart.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 2: Design – Seats, People &amp; Decisions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Build the Accountability Chart: functions → seats → people, with clear outcomes and interfaces.</li>
                <li>Populate the People Analyzer and run a first pass of values + GWC scoring.</li>
                <li>Draft the Right Person / Right Seat summary and identify the top people decisions for the next 1–3 quarters.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 3: Embed – Issues, L10 &amp; Culture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Move people/structure issues into a dedicated Issues List and IDS log.</li>
                <li>Design or refine your L10 rhythm: who’s in the room, agenda, scorecard, how issues are selected and solved.</li>
                <li>Use the Culture &amp; Accountability Heatmap to set a 12-month target and agree what “good” looks like.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Beyond Week 3: 90-Day Support</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Quarterly review of RPRS decisions and seat design as the business shifts.</li>
                <li>Support for tuning your Issues List and L10 cadence so the tool becomes how you run the company – not just a workshop artefact.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- CLIENT EXAMPLE -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Real Client Example</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Series A SaaS Company, $5M ARR:</strong> VP Sales and VP Marketing were constantly fighting about lead quality. Marketing said “we’re hitting lead volume targets” while Sales said “these leads are garbage.” The CEO spent 40% of their time mediating.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Root Issue:</strong> No one owned “qualified pipeline.” Marketing owned lead volume. Sales owned closed-won revenue. The gap between them was nobody’s problem – which meant it was everyone’s problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>After the Ownership &amp; Accountability Framework:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a “Director of Revenue Operations” role (promoted from within) who owned qualified pipeline.</li>
                <li>Marketing’s scorecard: MQLs that convert to SQLs at 35%+ rate (not just volume).</li>
                <li>Sales Development’s scorecard: SQLs that reach discovery stage at 60%+ rate.</li>
                <li>Weekly L10s with clear metrics: everyone sees the funnel health, no more finger-pointing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Result:</strong> Lead-to-SQL conversion improved from 18% to 38% in two quarters. CEO time spent mediating conflicts dropped to near zero. The team actually liked each other again.
