            Codifying the “one way we sell” and wiring it into your tools so every rep follows the same path from lead to signed contract and handoff.
        </p>
        <div class="problem-statement">
            <strong>The Problem:</strong> Your best reps close in spite of the system, not because of it. 
            Everyone has their own version of discovery, qualification, and proposal. Handoffs to CS/Finance are messy, 
            and data in the CRM doesn’t match what’s actually happening in deals.
        </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Without a standardised sales process and lead-to-cash workflow, every new hire is a new experiment. 
            Coaching is vague, forecasting is unreliable, and cross-functional coordination relies on individual heroics.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Build Together</h3>
        <div class="framework-grid">
            <div class="framework-card">
                <h4>Standard Sales Process</h4>
                <p>
                    We map the ideal sales journey from first touch to signed order form: stages, exit criteria, activities and 
                    stakeholders.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="framework-card">
                <h4>Deal Playbooks</h4>
                <p>
                    Practical playbooks for your key deal types (e.g. net-new, expansion, multi-year) with call plans, mutual action 
                    plans and templates.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h4>Lead-To-Cash Workflow</h4>
                <p>
                    Step-by-step flow from MQL → SQL → opportunity → closed-won → provisioning & billing, with clear roles and SLAs.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="framework-card">
                <h4>Tool-Embedded Process</h4>
                <p>
                    We translate the process into your CRM and sales engagement tools so reps are guided by the system, not slides.
